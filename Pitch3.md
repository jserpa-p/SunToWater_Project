# Pitch #3

## SunToWater

## In this project there are 3 people: Jos√©, Hugo and Guilherme

## Summary 

GlobeX aims to update and reconfigure the outdated IT infrastructure of its newly acquired subsidiary companies by implementing trought a script, a Active Directory and Domain Controller with Radius Authentication and a VPN access. 

This is to maintain regulatory compliance required for federal contracts, which is currently not being met due to the outdated IT systems.

## What problem or pain point does it solve?

Time-consuming and costly on-site visits for infrastructure upgrades: With remote deployment and management, organizations can upgrade their IT infrastructure without the need for on-site visits, reducing both the time and cost involved.

Difficulty managing individual components of the network: With the creation of a Domain Control, organizations can control their entire network from a single interface, streamlining the process and reducing the likelihood of errors or complications.

Inefficiencies in managing IT infrastructure: Remote deployment and management, along with the creation of a Domain Control, can help organizations improve the efficiency of their IT infrastructure management. This can result in cost savings and improved productivity.


## Minimum Viable Product (MVP):

The MVP for GlobeX would be a successful implementation of Active Directory and Domain Controller with Radius Authentication for at least one of its newly acquired subsidiary companies. 

The demo should showcase the improved compliance with federal regulations and the optimized functionality of the IT system achieved through this implementation.d
