GlobeX aims to update and reconfigure the outdated IT infrastructure of its newly acquired subsidiary companies to maintain regulatory compliance for federal contracts. This is achieved through task forces assembled under the GlobeX special projects division.

# Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition:
The MVP for GlobeX would be a demonstration of the successful completion of the IT infrastructure update and reconfiguration for at least one of its newly acquired subsidiary companies. The demo should showcase the improved compliance with federal regulations and the optimized functionality of the IT system.
