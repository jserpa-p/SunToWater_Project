# SunToWaterIT Infraestructure

# Context

As the IT infrastructure of modern businesses continues to evolve, companies must constantly strive to remain at the forefront of technological advancements to stay competitive. In today's world, technology plays a critical role in almost every aspect of a company's operations, from supply chain management to customer service.

Recently, GlobeX, a technology-focused company, acquired SunToWater, a company with a mission to make water-from-air drinking water more accessible to families. This acquisition is aligned with GlobeX's mission to promote ecological and energy-efficient solutions. However, SunToWater's IT infrastructure is outdated and not able to keep up with the demands of a rapidly expanding business.

As a result, GlobeX has tasked its IT department with updating SunToWater's core IT infrastructure to ensure it meets the needs of the company and its customers. This project is essential to improve efficiency, productivity, and scalability, as well as to support the future growth of SunToWater.

This project will be a significant undertaking that requires careful planning, collaboration, and execution. In this project, we will be exploring the various aspects of the update, software requirements, network security, AD, and more. With a well-planned strategy, we hope to deliver an IT infrastructure that supports SunToWater's mission and aligns with GlobeX's objectives.
