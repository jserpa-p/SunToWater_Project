# Summary 
GlobeX aims to update and reconfigure the outdated IT infrastructure of its newly acquired subsidiary companies to maintain regulatory compliance for federal contracts. The implementation of Active Directory and Domain Controller with Radius Authentication is a key part of achieving this goal.

Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition:
The MVP for GlobeX would be a successful implementation of Active Directory and Domain Controller with Radius Authentication for at least one of its newly acquired subsidiary companies. The demo should showcase the improved security and authentication protocols, as well as the ability to maintain regulatory compliance for federal contracts.
