# Planning

Our working schedule is a bit variable, it depends on the availability of the group. But mainly we will work starting at 6pm until, at least, the daily objective (set by us) is completed. 

# Cooperation Plan

In this project there are 3 people: José, Hugo and Guilherme

### Hugo
* **Key Strengths -** Problem Solving.
* **How and where to use those strengths -** Use my problem-solving skills in a wide range of settings. For instance, leverage my strengths in a professional setting by taking on a role that requires me to analyze data, diagnose problems, and develop solution.
* **Which is the professional ability that I want to develop -** I will benefit from developing my ability to plan. Planning involves setting clear goals and objectives, developing strategies to achieve those goals, and monitoring progress along the way.

### José
* **Key Strengths -** Communication.
* **How and where to use those strengths -** I'll use my communication skills in the presentation of the project and in the future in order for my ideas to be listened and easily understand.
* **Which is the professional ability that I want to develop -** Leadership. Not saying that I don't have any sense of leadership, but if I was a great leader combined with my communication skills I would be a valuable asset for any company

### Guilherme
* **Key Strengths -** Knowledge.
* **How and where to use those strengths -** I will use my knowlodge in the implementation phase of the project.
* **Which is the professional ability that I want to develop -** Communicate more precisely.

The way to every element of the group know exactly what is in the project is to every member be present in the daily meetings and submiting any question that one may have. This way there are no leaks in the group.

# Conflict Plan

**In case of disagreement about any subject related to the project**, firstly, after extensive study on the matter if we don't come to a consensus we vote. As we are 3 there will never be a tie and the decision will always be made.

In this group we thrive for growth in our peers learning skills, we would never let any of the 3 members take over the project alone. We work as a team and learn as a team.

As we meant to prosper with this project, we will help each other in any doubts that one may have. Having members that have different skills is very important for the groups balance and learning.

We will always be transparent with one another with everything related to the project.

In last resort, if thing are not going well inside, we call upon exterior help. From our colleagues of the other group, from the TAs, from the chief. The truth does not sum up to 3 people.

# Communication Plan

Since Guilherme and Hugo work, the communication will be from 18:00 onwards. But José is almost always available. 
We will use mainly Slack and Remo to communicate.
We'll take breaks when needed be. 
We are all 3 decent people who can stop and listen to what the other has to say so no one is left behind or unheard.

# Work Plan

The work will be devided by the 3 of us, we will always tell the others what we did and explain how we did as progress is made in the dailly meetings.

The project management tool chosen by all 3 is GitHub

# Presentation Deck

The presentation will be done in Google Docs using the template provided.
# Git Process

**The project will be divided in:**

The repository will be a private one but shareable with everyone that has the link to it.

Git Flow = We will use branches with PR reviews into the main branch as work flow.

The PRs will be reviewed and discussed at every meeting by all 3 members. The user of the github repository will be in charge of merging the PRs in the meetings.
